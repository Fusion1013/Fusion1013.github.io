The Final Escape is a game that was created for the course Game Project 2 at HIS. It was created by 11 people, where I was one of three programmers.

During the project I primarily focused on programming. I was mainly responsible for the Save System, Item Suspicion System, Puzzle Systems, as well as other smaller systems across the project.
