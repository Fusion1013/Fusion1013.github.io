Pompi is a game that was created for the course Game Project 1 at HIS. It was created by 5 people, where I was the only programmer. I was joined by a 2D artist, animator, a musician and a designer.

During the project I mainly focused on the programming, though I did help with other aspects of the project such as UI and level design.
