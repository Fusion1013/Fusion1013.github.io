Avasar is a worldbuilding project created by me and a few friends. I have mainly been working on the nations known as [The Saxum Sovereignty](https://fusion1013.github.io/avasar-web/Avasar/Major-Locations/Elisus/Saxum-Sovereignty/Saxum-Sovereignty-Overview), [Preia](https://fusion1013.github.io/avasar-web/Avasar/Major-Locations/Elisus/Pre%E1%B4%99/Pre%E1%B4%99-Overview) and [Ohkyr](https://fusion1013.github.io/avasar-web/Avasar/Major-Locations/Elisus/Ohkyr-Dominion/Ohkyr-Dominion-Overview). I have also worked a lot on the [languages](https://fusion1013.github.io/avasar-web/Avasar/Languages/Languages-Overview), as well as other miscellaneous things.

# Website
The [Website](https://fusion1013.github.io/avasar-web/Avasar/Home-Page) was created using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Since the main project is written in obsidian, Quartz made it easy to convert it into a static website.
