title: AGES Game Jam Autumn 2023 - Fall-ing in Love

I joined a team of 2 programmers and 2 designers for this game jam. The theme this game jam was "Fall". "Fall-ing in Love" is a gameshow-type game akin to hole in the wall. You play as a cat, falling through a tower. While falling a cat asks you questions, and you have to answer by falling through the correct holes.

My job during the project was to implement the dialogue system, as well as the UI for it. I also worked on a few other systems, such as the health, and taunting systems.
